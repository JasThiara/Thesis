\chapter{Future Work on Asset Bubble Detection and Conclusion}
\section{Future Work}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify this only detects bubbble when sigma square is certain to make equation 3 explode.
  \item when uncertainty arises, extrapolation is need to identify bubbles e.g rkhs, etc\cite{bigBubble,YAFEAISMB}
  \item Further exammination of testing historical examples of type 3 bubb;es is needed to determine assurance of tests and methodology.
  \item testing on longer periods of time(e.g 1 week instead of a day)and faster rates of data(e.g.seconds to seconds)
  stock price data instead of minute to minute \cite{bigBubble}
\end{enumerate}
