\subsection{Outline}
As for the outline, i think you should have four chapters:

(1) Introduction:\\
(1.1) What problem are you trying to solve?  Why is it important? What is your goal?\\
(1.2) Challenges\\
(1.3) Summary of how you’ve addressed those challenges, what have you found/built?\\
(1.4) Overview of following chapters\\










(2) Theoretical Background — The Math:\\
(2.1) Where does your problem come from? (you’ll have to talk about stochastic PDEs, volatility, assets price modeling, martingales, etc.) \\
(2.2) Describe the math problem: parametric estimation, interpolation, extrapolation, minimization\\
(2.3) What is your solution? Based on all this theory connecting math and finance and assets and asset bubbles, how can you get an answer to your (math) problem as you described in chapter (1).

(3) Algorithm and Implementation — The Software Tool:\\
— We can discuss later, but you may want to consider different format options: do you want to have a section for each sub problem (acquiring data, fitting data, extrapolation, etc.) 
or you may want to group some of those and have a separate section talking about software tools that you have downloaded/modified, and tools you have developed\\
— Also a section describing the Algorithm step by step.\\

(4) Numerical Examples — Once your code works, run some experiments on real data, some that you know the answer, some that you don’t know

You may want to have a final chapter with conclusions. future work, etc\\
